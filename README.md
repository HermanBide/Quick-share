## Additional Technologies

If you plan on using technologies outside of the scope of the course's content, please add them here. If you have developed any prototypes to test the technology, you can link them here as well if you'd like feedback.

## MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP.  Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
*These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features.*

- Find and use external api 
- Render data on page 
- Construct backend and connect to database
- Store use information and posts
- Allow user to choose favorites
- All users to post, comment and delete

#### PostMVP  
*These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features.*

- allow users to rate movies 
-allow users to click on movie link and direct use to movie page
- Use local storage to save user favorites

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all parts of your app.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the app must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add an additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Forms | H | 1hrs| 1hrs | hrs |
| registration | l | 2hrs| 2hrs | hrs |
| backend  | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | hrs |
| Home page | H | 2hrs| 2hrs | hrs |
| content page | l | 1hrs| 1hrs | hrs |
| styling Css | H | 2hrs| 2hrs | hrs |
| Total | H | 11hrs| 11hrs | hrs |

## SWOT Analysis

#### Strengths:
backend data arrangement along with authentication and Authorization

#### Weaknesses:
CSS styling content and responsiveness

#### Opportunities:
looking forward to learning more about SQL and PostgreSql

#### Threats:
